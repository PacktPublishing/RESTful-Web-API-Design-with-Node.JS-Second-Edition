# RESTful Web API Design with Node.JS Second Edition

This code targets developers who want to enrich their development skills by learning how to develop scalable, server-side, RESTful applications based on the Node.js platform. You also need to be aware of HTTP communication concepts and should have a working knowledge of the JavaScript language. Knowledge of REST would be an added advantage but is definitely not a necessity.
